# HoneyBoozle
Simple crossword puzzle helper using LINQ

This was whipped up in a couple hours to help my girlfriend solve crossword puzzles.
My main concern was ease of use and, obviously, performance.
Ended up being a fun look into how to navigate large collections with C# and LINQ.

## Instructions:

  Compile (or get it from the [releases page](https://github.com/knwldg/HoneyBoozle/releases)!), run and pick a word list upon startup. 
  
  Any .txt file with words delimited by a newline will work, this means you can use languages other than English.
  
  Use the filters to your liking!
  
  
Tested with the list from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), many thanks to the author.

I might make it more robust in the future, but feel free to send any pull requests if you have ideas to improve it.
